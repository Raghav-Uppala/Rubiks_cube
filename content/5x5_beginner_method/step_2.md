title="Step 2: Last 4 Centers"
weight = 2
+++

This steps is similar to the first step. You use the same trick that you use for the first step, in order to solve all of the centers. However instead of solving opposite centers, solve adjacent centers. Once you solve the first two centers, there is a new trick(almost an algorithm) that you apply to solve the last two. You apply this in order to swap some of the pieces.
