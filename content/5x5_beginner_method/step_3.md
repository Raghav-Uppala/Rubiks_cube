title="Step 3: Edge Pairing"
weight = 3
+++

In order to pair the edge pieces, follow the bellow steps:

1. Find 3 matching edge pieces and put them in the middle layers (not top/bottom)
2. Try to join them together using slice moves (flip an edge if necessary, using R U R' F R' F' R to flip the front right edge)
3. Move the solved edge into the top layer, replace it with an unsolved edge using U moves, and move this new edge back down
4. Restore all the centers by doing slice moves
5. If 1 edge is unsolved at the end, hold it on the front/top and do the parity algorithm. Parity Algorithm: Rw U2 x Rw U2 Rw U2 3Rw' U2 Lw U2 Rw' U2 Rw U2 Rw' U2 Rw'

Once you have finished this, the centers and edges will be solved. Then you can solve it like any 3x3 Rubik's Cube.
