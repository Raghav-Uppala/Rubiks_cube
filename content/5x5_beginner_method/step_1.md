+++

The first step is two solve the first two centers. The two centers are necessarily opposite to each other. Until you become color neutral, you should use the white and yellow sides as the first two centers.

Once you solve one of the centers, there is one trick that you need to know to solve the second center easily. Make one row or column of the second center on the side of the cube. Than, in order to insert it, move it to the location it should be in, and turn the face twice and the move it down. This prevents the first center from getting disturbed.
