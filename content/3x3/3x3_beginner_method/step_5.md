title="Step 5: Orientation of Yellow Corners"
weight = 5
+++

This is the final step. There is one algorithm that is required. In this step, you will orient each of the corners. Basicaly apply the algorithm until the corner is in the right orientation. Then you will rotate the U layer until the target corner is one that is not in the orientation. Then repeat. As you are doing this, the cube may become messed up, do not worry. Just keep going.

The algorithm for this is: R' D R D'

The bellow shows the target corner for the algorithm
