The beginer method is a good starting point in learning to solve the rubik's cube. Using this method you can get close to sub 1-minute times. Depending on your goal, this can be enough.

The begginer method contains the following steps: 
1. White side
2. Second layer
3. Yellow cross
4. Permutation of Yellow Corners
5. Orientation of Yellow Corners

The last two steps, are present in the beginner and advance(not covered in this website) CFOP methods. But the processes are different.
