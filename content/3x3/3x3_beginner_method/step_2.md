This step is not intuitive. As in, you have to learn an algorithm. 

The algorithm(A) is: (U R U' R') U' F' U F<br>
The mirror of the algorithm(A<sub>M</sub>) is: U' L' U L U F U' F'

These algorithms are used to insert the target piece in the slot.
|A|A<sub>M</sub>|

Use these algorithm(s) to move the target piece into the second layer.
