This step also requires an algorithm. There is only one algorithm, but there are multiple ways to apply it. You need to remember these applications.

Algorithm(A): F (R U R' U') F'

The cross will end up looking like this:<br>

|:-|:-|
|![](/images/bgm/bgm_dot_case.png)|In any orientation, apply the algorithm once and the case will change(to the next case).|
