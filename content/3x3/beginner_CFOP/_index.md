This is the beginner version of the CFOP method. CFOP is a speed cubing method that is responsible for the sub 5 second solves. CFOP is an acronym for the steps of itself. 

1. **C**ross
2. **F**irst 2 layers(F2L)
3. **O**rientation of Last Layer(OLL)
4. **P**ermutation of Last Layer(PLL).

However in the beginner method, the last two steps require looking at the cube twice. In the advance version you only have to look at the cube once. This will be further cleared in the specific page.
