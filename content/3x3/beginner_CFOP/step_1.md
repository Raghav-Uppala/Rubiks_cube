Cross is similar to the white side step in the beginner method. Except you only have to solve the edge pieces, not the corner pieces.

The cross can be solved on any side, but that is more advace. Being able to start the solve using any color, is called being color neutral. For the beginner CFOP method don't focus on that.

The cross is the only part of the CFOP method that is meant to be fully planned out in inspection. Inspection is 15 seconds.
