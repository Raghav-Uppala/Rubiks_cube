But how does it work? The following logic is in the context of cards. but the same can be applied to the the Rubik's cube

Well imagine 6 cards labeled 1 through 6. Imagine that these cards are not in numerical order, but you want them to be. How can you do this? There are many ways, but one of the ways is that you pick a spot, and keep swapping cards. For example, you may designate that the first card spot is the swap card. Look at where that card should be, and swap the card in that current position with the card in the swap card position. You can repeat this until the cards are in numerical order or until the card in the swap card position is meant to be in that position. Then you pick a new swap spot and repeat.
